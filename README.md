# Introduction
This is a robust reverse Polish notation calculator for polynomials with stdin parser and unit tests. All of the code is written in C and the unit test library [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/). The `polynomials` project was written for the 1st year course `Individual Programming Project` at the University of Warsaw.

# TODO
1. Explain polynomials in an abstract way
2. Describe polynomials operations
3. Describe parsing method with examples
4. Describe unit tests
5. Describe calculator operations (with examples)
6. Write what I would do better, after working several months in the industry
